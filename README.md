# Cybersecurite-2025

## Audience
I had the opportunity to present an introduction to cybersecurity to the French expat community in Houston. This group, which frequently travels and relies heavily on digital communication, often lacks awareness about cybersecurity, especially among those not working for large companies with comprehensive training programs. My presentation aimed to address this gap and provide essential knowledge to help them navigate the digital world more securely.


## Purpose

In my presentation, I provided an overview of cybersecurity, focusing on its growing importance and the various threats individuals and organizations face. Given their frequent travel and extensive use of digital communication, it was crucial to address these issues and enhance their awareness. Additionally, I highlighted how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence are introducing new challenges in cybersecurity, such as AI-driven cyber threats and the need for advanced defenses to counter them.

***What is Cybersecurity?***

I started by defining cybersecurity and explaining its significance. Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, which have been increasing at an alarming rate. The statistics and growing number of cyber incidents underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to safeguard against these evolving threats.

***Types of Cyberattacks***

In my presentation, I covered the different types of cyberattacks, illustrating them with concrete examples. I explained cybercriminal activities such as ransomware, phishing, and data theft, as well as threats to reputation and misinformation, including fake news and manipulation. I also addressed espionage and the collection of personal data, highlighting their impact on privacy and security. Additionally, I discussed sabotage as a form of cyberterrorism, demonstrating how these attacks can have severe consequences. Finally, I introduced the concept of cyberwarfare, emphasizing its growing role in global conflicts.

***Examples and Impact of Cyberattacks***

I presented notable examples like the Darkside group’s attack on Colonial Pipeline, the SolarWinds breach, and the WannaCry ransomware incident. I also explained how cyberattacks played a role in the start of the Ukraine conflict, highlighting the growing significance of cyberwarfare in today’s global landscape.

***Tips for Cybersecurity***

To help the audience adopt good cybersecurity habits, I shared practical prevention strategies. I emphasized the importance of securing devices and applications by using strong passwords, password managers, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and keeping software up to date with antivirus protection. I also discussed how to manage digital identity and protect online accounts, highlighting tools like 'Have I Been Pwned' and 'VirusTotal' for monitoring security breaches.

Additionally, I covered best practices for social media usage, stressing the risks of oversharing personal information and the potential for identity theft, phishing scams, and reputation damage. I explained how privacy settings, cautious friend requests, and awareness of manipulated content (such as fake news) can help mitigate these risks. Protecting personal data and privacy was another key focus, along with recognizing common cyber threats like phishing and data leaks.

Finally, I advised on what steps to take in case of an attack and introduced the role of government agencies in cybersecurity. I was pleased to see that the audience gained valuable insights and developed a stronger awareness of cybersecurity. They left with a clearer understanding of how to protect themselves online, including on social media, and contribute to the security of broader systems.
